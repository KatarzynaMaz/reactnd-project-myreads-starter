# MyReads Project 

This is one of the final projects for the FEND track. It's a React app that allows the user to select and categorize books. The starter template was provided, but doing project from srcatch was also an option. The goal of the starter template was to save the students time by providing a static example of the CSS and HTML markup that may be used. There was no React code included. The goal was to add interactivity to the app by refactoring the static code in this template.


## To run
   * Clone or download the project from [this repo](https://github.com/KatarzynaMaz/reactnd-project-myreads-starter/tree/working-reactnd-project-myreads-starter)
   * install all project dependencies with `npm install` in your terminal
   * start the development server with `npm start`

## To use 
   * Move books between shelves on the main page by selecting the shelf from the dropdown menu. 
   * A new book can be added by clicking the icon (plus sign on the right side of the page at the bottom) and typing
     your search and then updating the status of the book (drpdown menu)

## Backend Server

Backend server to develop against was provided to simplify development process for students.

## Important

The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend.
